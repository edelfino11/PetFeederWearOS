Compose Wear OS practice pet feeder app
=======================================
Practice app using Wear OS (Kotlin,jetpack Compose) 

This practice app is supposed to be a companion app to remind pet owners to feed their pet at a specific time of the day. As of now only there is only UI functionality. Currently investigating how to use the already existing reminder Wear OS app, for simpler development, and for Google synchronicity with phone's reminder app and Google Calendar. That way the app serves as a hub for pet feeding remainders only. I also need to set up an external database to store pet's info.

Features to add: add multiple pets, add multiple feeding times, add potential reminders to buy pet supplies.
